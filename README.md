# HALIA (Halo Analysis Interactive Application)

HALIA is an interactive simulation tool designed to explore the properties and dynamics of dark matter halos.
It allows users to calculate key halo parameters such as density, virial radius, and velocity dispersion, and even study how these quantities change under theories like string theory and extra dimensions.

The program combines classical gravitational models with theoretical extensions to give a broader view of how dark matter halos might behave in different conditions.

# Features

Calculates halo properties such as density, virial radius, and velocity dispersion.

Lets users input parameters like distance or halo mass for custom simulations.

Simulates the effect of extra dimensions or modified gravity based on string theory.

Displays numerical results with physical explanations of increases or decreases.

Helps visualize how dark matter halos might differ in alternative cosmological models.

A dark matter halo is very dense in the center and gets thinner as you move outwards.
We use a common formula called the NFW profile to describe this.

Enter the radius (r) from the center: 4
At radius r = 4.000, the density ρ = 0.00926

The virial radius marks roughly the edge of the dark matter halo.
Inside this radius, gravity and particle motions are balanced.

Enter the virial radius (R_vir): 8
Virial Radius: 8.000
Virial Mass (approx): 18.310
